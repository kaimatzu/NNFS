# Summary of Neural Networks From Scratch (NNFS)

This is my attempt to summarize the content from NNFS into a more digestible, organized, and concise format using markdown and Jupyter notebooks for self-study. Some parts of the original book (or at least the copy that I have) are erroneous. Those errors are ironed out here. 

Some content will be cut out as this is a summary of what I deem to be the most important parts, and some information that's not in the book will be added for explanations or further readings.

**Disclaimer: The contents in this repository are *somewhat* modified versions of the original content. Go buy the original book [here](https://nnfs.io/) to support the authors.**

Each chapter is subdivided into their own folders. I highly recommend you use an IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), etc. I also recommend you use the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) because some earlier versions do not support running Jupyter notebooks off the bat.
